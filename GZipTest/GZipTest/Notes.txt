1) Take out common part of CompressorMultithread.cs and ThreadPoolCompression.cs out, probably to Filemanipulator
2) Correct DecompressConcatenatedStreams so that it does not allocate such a big table - make it in chunks
3) Add Integration tests
4) Correct the Program.cs Main method so it looks human
5) in integration test take out the common part to separate function
6) Describe approach / algoritms / etc. Talk about sources that I used. Also talk about speed difference


AT THE END - RUN THE TESTS
